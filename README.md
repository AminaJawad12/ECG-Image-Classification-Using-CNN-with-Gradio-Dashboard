# 🫀 ECG Image Classification Using CNN with Gradio Dashboard

An end-to-end Deep Learning–based ECG Image Classification system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), integrated with an interactive Gradio medical dashboard.  
The system classifies ECG images into multiple cardiac conditions and provides clinical interpretation, risk assessment, and recommendations.

## 📌 Project Overview

Electrocardiograms (ECGs) play a crucial role in diagnosing heart-related conditions. This project leverages Computer Vision and Deep Learning to automatically classify ECG images into five categories:

- **Myocardial Infarction**  
- **History of Myocardial Infarction**  
- **Abnormal Heartbeat**  
- **Normal ECG**  
- **Non-ECG Images**  

The trained CNN model is deployed using Gradio, offering a user-friendly medical dashboard that displays predictions, confidence scores, and clinical insights.
